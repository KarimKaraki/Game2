Ok so basically 
In the game.java file we have a function called InitAliens
It creates anew alien everytime the alien enttity takes in the sprite of the
position coordoinates and then the direction left or right and the angle which
determines how the plate will we want to modify initaliens so that it feeds alienentity
a different angle depending on the level chosen. 
In the Alien entity file you will find the move function which moves the plate
we wan to modifye if to take in a number (level) which will determin the speed 
and in how many angles can the plate move, you are tasked with modiying both functions
in order to fit the new criteria, if you have any ideas of your own do not hesitiate
to ask else if you face any issue please take some time before contacting you pl
if there is something you dont understand in the code but the code still runs somehow
it means your not meant to understand it. thank you
